## Introduction

Unity Catalog is a unified governance solution for managing data assets in Azure Databricks. This project provides an overview of the steps required to set up Unity Catalog, including the creation of managed and external tables, and securing data with dynamic views.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:
- An Azure Subscription
- An Azure Databricks Workspace
- Admin access to Azure Databricks
- Basic knowledge of SQL and Databricks SQL

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Set Up Unity Catalog Metastore

1. **Create a Root Storage Account:** Set up an Azure Storage Account and create a container to store Unity Catalog data.
2. **Create the Azure Databricks Access Connector:** Set up the connector to grant Databricks access to the storage account.
3. **Create the Metastore in Azure Databricks Account Console:** Use the Account Console to create the metastore, linking it to the root storage account and access connector.

### 2. Create Catalog and Managed Table

1. **Create a Catalog:** Define a catalog to organize your data assets.
2. **Create a Schema and Managed Table:** Create a schema within the catalog and define a managed table to store your data.

### 3. Create External Table

1. **Upload Data Files:** Upload external data files to the storage container.
2. **Create External Table:** Define an external table that references the uploaded data files.

### 4. Provide Row-Level Security and Column-Level Filtering

1. **Create Dynamic Views:** Implement row-level security by creating views that filter data based on user attributes.
2. **Column-Level Filtering:** Create views that restrict access to specific columns based on user roles.
